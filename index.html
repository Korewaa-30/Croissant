		<h1>🥐 Croissant</h1>
		<p>
			"Croissant" is a buttery, flaky, and crescent-shaped pastry. It's a
			popular French pastry known for its delicious taste and distinctive
			layered texture. Croissants are often enjoyed as a breakfast item or snack
			and can be filled with various ingredients like chocolate or almond paste.
			They are made from layered yeast-leavened dough and butter, which is
			folded and rolled several times to create the characteristic flaky layers.
